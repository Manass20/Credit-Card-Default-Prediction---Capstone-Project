ðŸ“‹ Introduction -

Credit cards are usually small plastic cards with a unique number attached to an account.
Credit cards impose the condition that cardholders pay back the borrowed money, plus any applicable interest, as well as any additional agreed-upon charges, either in full by the billing date or over time.


-----------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“‹ Summary -
The main objective is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. This would inform the issuerâ€™s decisions on who to give a credit card to and what credit limit to provide. It would also help the issuer have a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted credit products to their customers.

ðŸ’¾ Conclusion -

From all baseline model, Random Forest classifier shows highest test accuracy and F1 score and AUC.
Baseline model of Random Forest and decision tree shows huge difference in  train and test accuracy which shows over fitting.
After cross validation and hyper parameter tuning, XG Boost shows highest test  accuracy score of 87% and AUC is 0.874.
Cross validation and hyper parameter tuning certainly reduces chances of  over fitting and also increases performance of model.
